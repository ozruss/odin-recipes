                <h3>Ingredients</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>4 (4 ounce) fillets tilapia</li>
                        <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
                        <li>1 tablespoon Cajun seasoning, or to taste</li>
                        <li>1 lemon, thinly sliced</li>
                        <li>¼ cup mayonnaise</li>
                        <li>½ cup sour cream</li>
                        <li>⅛ teaspoon garlic powder</li>
                        <li>1 teaspoon fresh lemon juice</li>
                        <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh dill</li>
                    </ul>
                        <h4>Steps</h4>
                            <ol>
                                <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a 9x13 inch baking dish.</li>
                                <li>Season the tilapia fillets with salt, pepper and Cajun seasoning on both sides. Arrange the seasoned fillets in a single layer in the baking dish. Place a layer of lemon slices over the fish fillets. I usually use about 2 slices on each piece so that it covers most of the surface of the fish.</li>
                                <li>Bake uncovered for 15 to 20 minutes in the preheated oven, or until fish flakes easily with a fork.</li>
                                <li>While the fish is baking, mix together the mayonnaise, sour cream, garlic powder, lemon juice and dill in a small bowl. Serve with tilapia.</li>
                            </ol>
